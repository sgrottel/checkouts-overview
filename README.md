# Checkouts Overview
Overview dashboard app for source code repository checkouts.

## Why this App?
In my private setup, I have a lot of smaller repos checked out (almost all git), and work on them occasionally.
In addition I got several repos to collect the history of some text documents and files.
Some of those repos are synced agains servers which are only occasionally online (power saving).
As a result, I keep loosing track of the sync states of all the different repos.

Is everything checked in? -- most times, yes. If the change was complete.

Is everything pushed? -- maybe.

Am I on branches? -- no idea.

At least for the first question, Windows Explorer overlay icons might have worked.
But thanks to the brutal limitation and the ongoing overlay-icon war, those are as unreliable as it gets.
And for everything else, you might not need this app or any other tool, if you have a better structured work process with your stuff.
I don't, so I need help by a tool.

And, that's why I decided to write this app.
